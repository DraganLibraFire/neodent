# Neodent

This is the theme framework for WordPress. Built by Verteez.

## Features

Lightweight, small-footprint, responsive and simple to use starter theme built by Verteez. Built upon [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework.

* Advanced theme settings. But this theme works right out of the box without special settings.  The only thing you might want to set up is your nav menus.
* Custom "Formats" page template that links to all your post format archives.
* Several nav menus for interesting uses.
* Post thumbnails that work with WordPress' featured image functionality and provide extra features.
* Dynamic body, post, and comment CSS classes.
* Fully internationalized, so you can run the theme in any language.
* RTL support
* And much more!

## Important Notes

### Social and Share menu

The Social menu and share feature uses FontAwesome rather than text to display links.  You simply need to type in the correct URL for your menu items.  The theme will take care of the rest.  The only social Web sites supported are sites that have icons in the [FontAwesome font](http://fontawesome.io/) package.  Anything else will display a star icon.
